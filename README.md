 # Problem Statement :
AtliQ Hardware, a rapidly expanding company in the electronics and goods market with a global presence, is encountering significant challenges in its data analysis practices.
Historically, the organization heavily relied on Excel for data analysis, which has proven to be an ineffective approach. Consequently, AtliQ Hardware has incurred losses when attempting to establish businesses in untapped markets.
In response to this issue, the company has taken the initiative to onboard a data analytics team to gain valuable insights across all departments, ultimately aiming for a comprehensive 360-degree view of their business.
